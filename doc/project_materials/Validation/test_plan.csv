Scenario,Objective,Test Environment,Test Data,Notes
SR_01 Crisis Decision,Ensure correct classification of crisis based on number of alert items,"Various sensors (PIR/IMU, gas, sound), Arduino, IoT Network Manager, Rule Engine, Server","Counts of 0, 1, 2+ alert items",Define thresholds for normal/caution/danger
SR_02 Lifestyle Pattern Analysis,Monitor lifestyle metrics to identify anomalies,"Load cells, bed pressure, temperature sensors, location sensors, Rule Engine","Rice/trash/laundry weight, bed time, heating/cooling patterns, location",Establish baseline consumption and activity patterns
SR_03 Fall Detection,Detect falls via accelerometer and sound sensors,"IMU (gyro) sensor, sound sensor, Arduino, IoT Network Manager, Rule Engine","Acceleration spikes, crash sound events, inactivity duration",Differentiate falls from normal vigorous activities
SR_04 Exit Management,Determine exit/entry and conscious vs unconscious exits using RFID and sensors,"RFID tags/readers, door sensors, GPS/location services, Rule Engine","RFID present/absent, door open events, timestamp, user location",Define authorised schedule and thresholds for unauthorised exits
SR_05 Emergency Situation Detection,"Identify emergencies via gas leaks, unusual sounds, and manual calls","Gas sensors, microphones, emergency button, Rule Engine","Gas concentration levels, scream audio samples, user button presses",Set proper thresholds for gas and sound intensity
SR_06 Manual Override,Allow authorised users to cancel alerts when there is no real emergency,"Admin UI, server, authentication system","Active alerts, admin versus guardian permissions",Ensure proper access control
SR_07 Integrated Dashboard,Aggregate sensor statuses and display risk level and alerts,"Dashboard UI (web/PyQt), sensors, Rule Engine","Normal sensor data, sensor faults, varying risk levels",Check real-time updates and visualisations
SR_08 Access Rights,Ensure guardians authenticate correctly to access the system,"Login system, authentication tokens, server, database","Correct/incorrect credentials, expired tokens",Consider implementing multi-factor authentication
SR_09 App/Web Service,"Record support activities, share information, view service status, and place emergency calls","Web/mobile app, backend server, database","Service logs, emergency call triggers, status requests",Ensure data sync across devices
SR_10 Medication Reminder,Send medication reminders at scheduled times and confirm user responses,"Scheduler service, smart device or speaker, app, database","Scheduled medication times, user acknowledgment actions",Personalise schedules per user
