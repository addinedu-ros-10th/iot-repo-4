Scenario,Test ID,Description,Precondition,Steps,Expected Result
SR_01,CR-01,No alert items (normal state),"System armed, thresholds defined",Provide sensor data with no abnormal readings for 10 minutes,"Crisis level = normal, no alert sent"
SR_01,CR-02,Single alert item (caution state),"System armed, thresholds defined",Trigger one sensor event above threshold while others stay normal,"Crisis level = caution, caution alert sent to app"
SR_01,CR-03,Multiple alert items (danger state),"System armed, thresholds defined",Trigger two or more sensor events above threshold simultaneously,"Crisis level = danger, emergency alert and 119 call triggered"
SR_02,LP-01,Normal lifestyle pattern,Baseline lifestyle profile learnt,"Send typical sensor data for rice, trash, laundry, bed time, heating usage","No anomalies detected, no alert"
SR_02,LP-02,Reduced food consumption and no outings,Baseline lifestyle profile learnt,"For three days, send low rice/trash/laundry values and zero movement outside",Warning sent: low consumption and no outings
SR_02,LP-03,Excessive bed stay time,Baseline lifestyle profile learnt,Send bed pressure sensor data showing 12 hours in bed per day,Anomaly alert about increased bed stay sent to guardians
SR_03,FD-01,Real fall event,IMU and sound sensors calibrated,Generate a high acceleration followed by a loud crash sound and then 30 seconds inactivity,"Fall detected, buzzer/lamp activated, emergency notifications sent"
SR_03,FD-02,False fall due to vigorous movement,IMU and sound sensors calibrated,Generate high acceleration without crash sound and with immediate movement resuming,"No fall detected, monitoring continues"
SR_04,DM-01,Authorised exit,RFID card registered,"Swipe RFID card and open door during allowed hours, exit and return","Entry/exit recorded, no anomaly"
SR_04,DM-02,Unconscious/unauthorised exit,RFID reader and door sensor online,"Open door without RFID and leave premises, based on GPS data","Unauthorised exit detected, alert sent"
SR_05,EM-01,Gas leak,Gas sensor calibrated,Simulate gas concentration above threshold for 20 seconds,"Emergency identified, gas valve closed, 119 notified"
SR_05,EM-02,Scream detected,Sound analysis algorithm loaded,Input a scream audio sample exceeding noise threshold,"Emergency alert triggered, notifications sent"
SR_05,EM-03,Manual emergency report,Emergency button active,User presses emergency button,"Immediate emergency process started, notifications sent"
SR_06,MO-01,Admin cancels alert,"Active alert present, admin logged in",Admin selects active alert and clicks dismiss,"Alert cleared, log updated"
SR_06,MO-02,Unauthorised user attempts dismiss,"Active alert present, guardian logged in",Guardian tries to dismiss alert via UI,"Permission denied, alert remains"
SR_07,DB-01,Sensor status monitoring,All sensors registered,Send normal data from sensors then stop data from one sensor,Dashboard shows all sensors normal then flags one sensor as error
SR_07,DB-02,Risk level display,Risk algorithm available,Gradually increase risk score from normal to danger thresholds,Dashboard updates risk level indicator and sends alerts appropriately
SR_08,AU-01,Guardian logs in with correct credentials,Guardian account created,Enter valid username/password and complete authentication,"Login success, access to dashboard granted"
SR_08,AU-02,Invalid credentials,Guardian account exists,Enter wrong password,"Login failure, error message displayed"
